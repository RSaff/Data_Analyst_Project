# Analysis of the Value and Volume of Indonesia's Fisheries Product Exports and Imports
## Objectives
Over the past five years, from 2018 to 2023, Indonesia has emerged as a key player in the global trade of fisheries products. Statistical data indicates significant trends in the value and volume of fisheries product exports and imports during this period. This underscores the importance of the fisheries sector for Indonesia's economy and food sustainability. According to data from the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the fisheries sector plays a crucial role in the country's economic growth and serves as a primary food source for the population. 

By analyzing the trends and patterns in fisheries product trade, the government can formulate appropriate trade policies, promote the sustainability of the fisheries sector, and ensure an adequate food supply for the Indonesian population. Therefore, analyzing the value and volume of fisheries product exports and imports during the period 2018-2023 will provide a better understanding of the dynamics of Indonesia's fisheries sector and its impact on the economy and food sustainability of the country.

1. **Trends of Increase and Decrease**: The data indicates a tendency for the value of fisheries product exports and imports to increase from year to year. However, there was a decrease in 2023. This may be attributed to factors such as changes in global market demand, price fluctuations, or evolving trade policies. Meanwhile, the volume of exports and imports experienced greater fluctuations over the five-year period, influenced by factors such as fishing seasons, trade regulations, and changes in demand and supply.
2. **Highest Changes in Value and Volume**: The year 2022 exhibited the highest changes in the value of fisheries product exports and imports, while 2021 saw a decline in export and import volumes. This indicates significant fluctuations in fisheries product trading activities, possibly influenced by external factors such as changes in global market demand or alterations in trade policies.
3. **Top Destination Countries**: China ranks as the top destination country with the highest volume of fisheries product exports over the past five years, followed by the United States and Japan. This suggests that Asian markets, particularly China, remain the primary destinations for Indonesian fisheries product exports, with significant market potential and stable demand.
4. **Leading Commodities**: Based on the data, the fisheries commodities with the highest export volumes are "other commodities", followed by seaweed, shrimp, tuna-skipjack-bonito, and squid-octopus-cuttlefish. This indicates variation in Indonesia's fisheries product portfolio and competitive advantages in certain types of commodities.
5. **Comparison between Export and Import Volumes**: The correlation between the export and import volumes of fisheries products is dominated by export volume. This suggests that Indonesia tends to be a net exporter in fisheries product trade, indicating potential competitive advantages in the fisheries industry.
